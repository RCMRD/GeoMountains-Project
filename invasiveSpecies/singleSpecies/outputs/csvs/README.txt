The order in which CSV files were written is as follows;
1) Using all variables as explanatory variables;
	- Opuntia_models_scores
		Obtaining models evaluation scores
	- plotByALGO
		Evaluation of model scores through an Algorithm plot
	- plotByRUN
		Evaluation of model scores through a RUN plot
	- plotByPA
		Evaluation of model scores through a Pseudo-Absence plot
	- Opuntia_models_variable_importance
		Obtaining the variable importance
	- Opuntia_models_mean_VariableImportance
 		Obtaining the mean of variable importance by algorithm

2) Using all variables as explanatory variables;
	- Acacia_models_scores
		Obtaining models evaluation scores
	- plotByALGO
		Evaluation of model scores through an Algorithm plot
	- plotByRUN
		Evaluation of model scores through a RUN plot
	- plotByPA
		Evaluation of model scores through a Pseudo-Absence plot
	- Opuntia_models_variable_importance
		Obtaining the variable importance
	- Opuntia_models_mean_VariableImportance
 		Obtaining the mean of variable importance by algorithm


The folders labelled as;
	- "Acacia" and "Opuntia" - are csv outputs using Bioclimatic variables only
	- "Acacia_2.0" and "Opuntia_2.0" - are csv outputs using Biophysical variables only
