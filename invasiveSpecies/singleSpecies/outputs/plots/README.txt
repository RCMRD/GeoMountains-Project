The order in which plots were obtained is as follows
1) Using all variables as explanatory variables;
	# A. 	plotByALGO
		plotByRUN
		plotByPA

	#B. 	Generalized Linear Model
		Generalized Boosted Regression Model
		Random Forest Model
		Generalized Additive Model

2) Using selected variables as explanatory variables (15, 4, 7, 6);
	# A. 	plotSelectByALGO
		plotSelectByRUN
		plotSelectByPA

	#B. 	Random Forest Model (selection)
		Generalized Boosted Regression Model (selection)


The folders labelled as;
	- "Acacia" and "Opuntia" - are graphic outputs using Bioclimatic variables only
	- "Acacia_2.0" and "Opuntia_2.0" - are graphic outputs using Biophysical variables only
